# video_vault.py - Main video vault file that imports core and UI components
"""
Video Vault for the Secret Vault App

This file combines the core video vault functionality with the UI components.
Split into separate files for better organization and easier debugging:

- video_vault_core.py: Core functionality (file operations, thumbnail generation, deletion)
- video_vault_ui.py: User interface components (gallery widget, file selection dialogs)

The main issue we're solving is Windows file locking when trying to delete videos.
This happens because OpenCV's VideoCapture objects don't release file handles properly.

Key fixes implemented:
1. Comprehensive tracking of all OpenCV VideoCapture objects
2. Immediate and explicit release of all captures after use
3. Multiple deletion methods with fallbacks
4. Process killing for stubborn file locks
5. Aggressive cleanup with garbage collection
6. Detailed logging to track what's happening

Usage:
- Import and use integrate_video_vault(app) in your main app
- The vault will handle video import, thumbnail generation, and secure deletion
- Videos can be moved (more secure) or copied to the vault
- Supports both Android and desktop platforms
